Long, long ago there lived a king.
He loved horses.
One day he asked an artist to draw him a beautiful horse.
The artist said, "All right, but you must wait."
So the king waited.
He waited and waited.
At last, after a year he could not wait any longer.
He went to see the artist himself.

Quickly the artist brought out paper and a brush.
In five minutes he finished drawing a very beautiful horse.
The king was angry.
"You can draw a good horse in five minutes, yet you kept me waiting for a year. Why?"

"Come with me, please."
said the artist.
They went to the artist's workroom.
There they saw piles and piles of paper.
On every piece of paper was a picture of a horse.
"It took me more than a year to learn to draw a beautiful horse in five minutes."
the artist said.
